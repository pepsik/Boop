##Rebuild

This is my first git project which evolved from simple example Spitter of 'Spring in Action' by Craig Walls.

Started with simple web-application(book example with a few changes) where user can register an account and post messages, have public profile and avatar img, the project has turned into a portal. It has features such as tags, favorites, comments to posts, ratings, wysiwyg summernote as editor and others that is under the hood.

This is a training project where I learning some Java frameworks (Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Boot, Jpa2/Hibernate, JUnit, Mockito and others) and bit js, html, css, AngularJs as front-end of my app.

or Example(temp)

This is my first git project which evolved from simple example Spitter of 'Spring in Action' by Craig Walls.

Started with simple web-application(book example with a few changes) where user can register an account and post messages,
have public profile and avatar img, the project has turned into a portal. It has features such as tags, favorites,
comments to posts, ratings(in p), wysiwyg summernote as editor and others that is under the hood.

This is a training project where I learning some Java frameworks (Spring, Sping MVC, Jpa-Hibernate, Jsp, Apache Tiles) 
and bit js, html, css as front-end of my app. I am learning Java, so my front-end will be similar to the trash. (java too but less)
